Mid Series
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Livox Mid-40 LiDAR sensor is incredibly cost effective. It detects objects as far as 260 meters away and uses an advanced non-repetitive scanning pattern to deliver highly accurate details in the FOV. A compact body enables users to easily embed units into existing designs for greater flexibility and performance. The Mid-40 has been mass-produced and is ready to ship immediately to facilitate uses in autonomous driving, robotics, mapping, security, and other areas from small batch testing to large-scale applications.For more infomation：
