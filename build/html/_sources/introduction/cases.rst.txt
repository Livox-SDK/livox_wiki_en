Livox Technical Applications
----------------------------------

**1.LOAM-Livox Makes Easier Lidar by Shortening the Algorithm Development Cycle**

The demonstration of actual effect of Livox Horizon proves the feasibility of applying its non-repetitive scanning of point cloud data to existing high-performance algorithms. The cost reduction far surpasses the inevitable cost of algorithm swapping.

**2.Stationary Environment 3D Scanning - Efficient and Portable Mid-40 solution on a Tripod**

In this case, we use one Mid-40 and the motor mounted on top of a tripod to rotate around the z axis to scan different parts of the room, and integrate the point cloud data to give an overall 3D image.

**3.Mobile 3D Mapping - LiDAR Odometry and Mapping Algorithms Package from HKU**

To demonstrate the enormous potential of Livox LiDAR products in mobile 3D mapping, the Mechatronic and Robotic Systems (MaRS) laboratory (in the University of Hong Kong (HKU) has developed a LiDAR odometry and mapping (LOAM) algorithm specifically for Livox LiDARs – LOAM-Livox. The LOAM algorithms are open source and are available for free for the benefit developers and customers
